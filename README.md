PyShell is a POSIX compliant shell application made from scratch in Python. It is capable of interpreting shell commands, running external programs and builtin commands like `cd`, `pwd`, `echo`, `cat`, and more. I tried my best to use little to no external packages in developing this application hence the "from scratch" approach.

In the process of doing this application I learned a lot about
- REPL
- parsing commands by handling quoting and escape sequences
- factory pattern and separation of concerns
- directory navigation
- output and error redirection
- autocompletions
